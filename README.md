Before running, please check your Python environment and install the appropriate packages using  ` pip install` .
The list of required packages is as follows:
- `pip install nltk` 
- `pip install openai`
- `pip install PyQt5`
- `pip install python-docx`
- `pip install docx2txt`
- `pip install pandas`

## **QualiGPT-v0.1.0-alpha**
We have released the **[QualiGPT-v0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/KindOPSTAR/QualiGPT/releases)** (Windows) version for testing. If you prefer not to build from the source code, please use this version.

## **QuickStart**
Please download `QualiGPT-v0.1.0-alpha.exe` from [Version Release](https://github.com/KindOPSTAR/QualiGPT/releases).

## **Source Code & Usage**
We have fully open-sourced the early version of this program, providing both .py and .ipynb files to build QualiGPT-v0.1.0-alpha. For a detailed description, please refer to the [Version Release](https://github.com/KindOPSTAR/QualiGPT/releases).

Once you have installed all the packages required for this tool, please download the 'QualiGPTApp.py' file and run it (`python QualiGPTApp.py`) through the `command prompt` (cmd), or **(highly recommended)** compile from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

If you are using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), you can download 'QualiGPTApp.ipynb' and run it within Jupyter Notebook. However, please note that after each run, you'll need to restart the kernel to run it again.
